    We are planning a study of a continuous response variable from matched
    pairs of study subjects. Prior data indicate that the difference in the
    response of matched pairs is normally distributed with standard deviation
    {{round(model.sigma)}}. If the true difference in the mean response of
    matched pairs is {{round(model.delta)}}, we will need to study
    {{ceil(model.n)}} pairs of subjects to be able to reject the null
    hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power)
    {{round(model.power)}}. The Type I error probability associated with this
    test of this null hypothesis is {{round(model.alpha)}}.
