    We are planning a study of a continuous response variable from matched
    pairs of study subjects. Prior data indicate that the difference in the
    response of matched pairs is normally distributed with standard deviation
    {{modelSet.model.sigma}}. If the true difference in the mean response of
    matched pairs is {{modelSet.model.delta}}, we will need to study
    {{modelSet.model.n}} pairs of subjects to be able to reject the null
    hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power)
    {{modelSet.model.power}}. The Type I error probability associated with this
    test of this null hypothesis is {{modelSet.model.alpha}}.
