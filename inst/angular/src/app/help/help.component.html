  <h5>Introduction</h5>
  <p>
    PS is a program for performing power and sample size calculations. You are
    using a web-enabled beta-test version of the program, where we are actively
    working on the interactive user interface. Currently, it can only be used
    for paired t-tests but it will be expanded for use in studies with
    dichotomous, continuous, survival response and other data.
  </p>
  <h5>Program Output</h5>
  <p>
    The program can determine the sample size needed to detect a specified
    alternative hypothesis with the required power, the power with which a
    specific alternative hypothesis can be detected with a given sample size,
    or the specific alternative hypotheses that can be detected with a given
    power and sample size. It also gives the 95% confidence interval for the
    test statistic under the specified alternative hypothesis as a measure of
    the precision of the test statistic.
  </p>
  <h5>Interactive Help</h5>
  <p>
    Click on any question-mark icon for help or pull-down menu to determine
    the needed information. In the Start tab, choose one of sample size,
    power, or detectable difference  and then complete the other fields that
    appear. Hover over the i icon for information on what is needed in each
    field. Then click the calculate button. A new tab will appear with
    sliders for altering the input variables, the desired output variable and
    various graphs.
  </p>
  <h5>Graphical Output</h5>
  <p>
    The graphs that can be generated are sample size vs. power, sample size
    vs. the detectable alternative hypothesis, power vs. sample size, and
    power vs. the detectable alternative hypothesis.  The y-axes of these
    graphs are always show the output variable. In addition, a graph of
    precision vs effect size is always given.  The red dot on the top two
    graphs can be dragged to enhance the users intuition on how the input and
    output variables interact.
  </p>
  <h5>Interpretation</h5>
  <p>
    The output also includes text that describes the power or sample size
    calculation in English, which may be a useful starting point for a
    description in a grant application.

  <p>Select one of the following:</p>
  <h5>Sample size</h5>
  <p>
    For independent t-tests this is the number of experimental patients that
    must be studied to detect a true difference in population means &delta;
    with Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation &sigma;
    and <em>m</em> controls per experimental patient. For paired t-tests it
    is the number of pairs of patients needed to detect a true difference in
    population means &delta; with Type I error probability &alpha; given a
    standard deviation &sigma;.
  </p>
  <h5>Power</h5>
  <p>
    For independent studies it is the probability of rejecting the null
    hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified
    sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; and a control/experimental
    patient ratio <em>m</em> when the true difference in population means is
    &delta;. For paired studies it is the probability of rejecting the null
    hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified
    sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; when the true difference in
    population means is &delta;.
  </p>
  <h5>Detectable alternative</h5>
  <p>
    A difference in population means that can be detected with the specified
    power and Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation
    &sigma;, and the specified sample size.
