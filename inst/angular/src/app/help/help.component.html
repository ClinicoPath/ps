    Continuous Response Measures in Two Groups -- Paired and independent t-tests:
    The approach of <a href="#ref3">Dupont and Plummer (1990)</a> is used for
    paired and independent samples.  The ratio of number of patients in the
    samples being compared may be specified by the user.  This method produces
    results that are in close agreement with those of
    <a href="#ref6">Pearson and Hartley (1970)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each null hypothesis is tested with respect to a two-sided alternative
    hypothesis.
  </p>

  <h4>Output</h4>

  <h5>Sample size</h5>
  <p>
    For independent t-tests this is the number of experimental patients
    that must be studied to detect a true difference in population means
    &delta; with Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard
    deviation &sigma; and <i>m</i> controls per experimental patient.  For
    paired t-tests it is the number of pairs of patients needed to detect a
    true difference in population means &delta; with Type I error
    probability &alpha; given a standard deviation &sigma;.
  </p>

  <h5>Power</h5>
  <p>
    For independent studies it is the probability of rejecting the null
    hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified
    sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; and a control/experimental
    patient ratio <i>m</i> when the true difference in population means is
    &delta;.  For paired studies it is the probability of rejecting the
    null hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the
    specified sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; when the true
    difference in population means is &delta;.
  </p>

  <h5>Detectable alternative</h5>
  <p>
    A difference in population means that can be detected with the
    specified power and Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard
    deviation &sigma;, and the specified sample size.
  </p>

  <h4>Input</h4>

  <h5>Type I error (&alpha;)</h5>
  <p>
    The Type I error probability for a two sided test.  This is the probability
    that we will falsely reject the null hypothesis.
  </p>

  <h5>Sample size (<em>n</em>)</h5>
  <p>
    For independent t-tests <em>n</em> is the number of experimental subjects.  For
    pair test <em>n</em> is the number of pairs.
  </p>

  <h5>Power</h5>
  <p>
    For independent tests <i>power</i> is probability of correctly rejecting the
    null hypothesis of equal population means given <i>n</i> experimental
    patients, <i>m</i> control patients per experimental patient,  a Type I error
    probability &alpha; and a true difference in population means of &delta;.
    For paired tests it is the probability of correctly rejecting the null
    hypothesis of equal population means given <i>n</i> pairs of patients, a Type
    I error probability &alpha; and a true difference in population means of
    &delta;.
  </p>

  <h5>Difference in population means (&delta;)</h5>

  <h5>Standard deviation (&sigma;)</h5>
  <p>
    For independent tests &sigma; is the within group standard deviation.  For
    paired designs it is the standard deviation of difference in the response of
    matched pairs.
  </p>

  <h5>Ratio (<i>m</i>)</h5>
  <p>
    For independent tests <i>m</i> is the ratio of control to experimental
    patients.  <i>m</i> is not defined for paired studies.
