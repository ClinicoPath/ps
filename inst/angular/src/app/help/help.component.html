  <h5>Introduction</h5>
  <p>
    PS is a program for performing power and sample size calculations. You 
    are using a web-enabled beta-test version of the program, where we 
    are actively working on the interactive user interface. Currently, it 
    can only be used for t-tests, z-tests and tests with dichotomous 
    outcomes. It will be expanded for use in studies with survival 
    response and other data.
  </p>
  <h5>Program Output</h5>
  <p>
    The program can determine the sample size needed to detect a 
    specified alternative hypothesis with the required power, the 
    power with which a specific alternative hypothesis can be 
    detected with a given sample size, or the specific alternative 
    hypotheses that can be detected with a given power and sample 
    size. It also gives the 95% confidence interval for the test 
    statistic under the specified alternative hypothesis as a 
    measure of the precision of the test statistic.
  </p>
  <h5>Interactive Help</h5>
  <p>
    Click on any question-mark icon or white i in a black circle for help 
    to determine the needed information. In the <em>Start</em> tab, choose one of 
    sample size, power, or detectable difference and then complete the 
    other fields that appear. Hover over the i icon for information 
    on what is needed in each field. Then click the <em>Calculate</em> button. A 
    new tab will appear with sliders for altering the input variables, the 
    desired output variable and various graphs. Alternately, choose 
    an example from the upper-right pull-down menu for a pre-populated 
    example and click on <em>Calculate</em>.
  </p>
  <h5>Graphical Output</h5>
  <p>
    The graphs that can be generated are sample size vs. power, sample 
    size vs. the detectable alternative hypothesis, power vs. sample 
    size, and power vs. the detectable alternative hypothesis. The 
    y-axes of these graphs are always show the output variable. In 
    addition, a graph of precision vs effect size is always given. The 
    red dot on the top two graphs can be dragged to enhance the userâ€™s 
    intuition on how the input and output variables interact. The dot 
    giving the effect size in the lower panel many also be dragged, 
    as can the vertical bars indicating the limits of the 95% confidence 
    interval when the output is not sample size.
  </p>

  <h5>Add Line</h5>
  <p>Clicking on <em>Add line</em> overlays a new set of graphs on top of the old 
    ones. This new graph can then be modified to permit multiple graphs 
    on each plot. A legend is automatically generated. The names of the 
    curves can be modified by changing the Name field near the top of 
    the dialog box. Clicking on the left-most tab (blue by default) gives 
    access to the initial plot whose legend name may also be modified. The 
    legend itself can be dragged to a suitable position on each graph.
  </p>
  
   
  <h5>Options gear wheel</h5>
  <p>
    Click on this icon to change the point size, line width and other graph
    options.
  </p>

  <h5>Save icon</h5>
  <p>Click on this icon to save graphs in one of several formats. Graphs 
    in WMF format can be readily imported into Microsoft PowerPoint for further editing.</p>

  <h5>Cube icon</h5>
  <p>By default, hovering over a line on a graph will give you the 
    values of the x- and y-axes at the point where you are hovering. Clicking 
    on the <em>Cube</em> icon toggles this feature on or off.</p>

  <h5>Interpretation</h5>
  <p>The output also includes text that describes the power or sample size 
    calculation in English, which may be a useful starting point for a 
    description in a grant application.</p>

  <h5>Log</h5>
  <p>A terse description of the calculations performed is abailable by 
  clicking on <em>Log</em> in the gray box. The log file may then be cut 
    and pasted into other editors.</p>

  <p>Select one of the following:</p>
  <h5>Sample size</h5>
  <p>
    For independent t-tests this is the number of experimental patients that
    must be studied to detect a true difference in population means &delta;
    with Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation &sigma;
    and <em>m</em> controls per experimental patient. For paired t-tests it
    is the number of pairs of patients needed to detect a true difference in
    population means &delta; with Type I error probability &alpha; given a
    standard deviation &sigma;.
  </p>
  <h5>Power</h5>
  <p>
    For independent studies it is the probability of rejecting the null
    hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified
    sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; and a control/experimental
    patient ratio <em>m</em> when the true difference in population means is
    &delta;. For paired studies it is the probability of rejecting the null
    hypothesis with Type I error probability &alpha; given the specified
    sample size, a standard deviation &sigma; when the true difference in
    population means is &delta;.
  </p>
  <h5>Detectable alternative</h5>
  <p>
    A difference in population means that can be detected with the specified
    power and Type I error probability &alpha; given a standard deviation
    &sigma;, and the specified sample size.
