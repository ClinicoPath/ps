PS: Power and Sample Size Calculation
=====================================

PS is an interactive program for performing power and sample size calculations
that may be downloaded for free. It can be used for studies with dichotomous,
continuous, or survival response measures. The alternative hypothesis of
interest may be specified either in terms of differing response rates, means,
or survival times, or in terms of relative risks or odds ratios. Studies with
dichotomous or continuous outcomes may involve either a matched or independent
study design. The program can determine the sample size needed to detect a
specified alternative hypothesis with the required power, the power with which
a specific alternative hypothesis can be detected with a given sample size, or
the specific alternative hypotheses that can be detected with a given power and
sample size.

The PS program can produce graphs to explore the relationships between power,
sample size and detectable alternative hypotheses. It is often helpful to hold
one of these variables constant and plot the other two against each other. The
program can generate graphs of sample size versus power for a specific
alternative hypothesis, sample size versus detectable alternative hypotheses
for a specified power, or power versus detectable alternative hypotheses for a
specified sample size. Linear or logarithmic axes may be used for either axes.
Multiple curves can be plotted on a single graphic.
